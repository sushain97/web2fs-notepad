web2fs-notepad
===============

Minimal web-based notepad with versioning. Data is stored directly
on the filesystem making backups easy, searching as simple as a
`grep` and limiting runtime dependencies to PHP.

Uses [Symfony][1] on the backend and ES6 transpiled with [Webpack][2].
CSS is provided courtesy of [Basscss][3].
